// Searching time is good in BInary ST in normal tree but in case of skew tree it break.....and have TC of O(n)
// abs(h(t2)-h(t1))<=1 this is called balanced factor of this Node.
// an empty binary tree  is called avl treee
// avl tree is a self balancing tree
// LL RR single rotation
// LR RL double rotation  
// RR rotation A left B head anti  
// LR RL mai C ko head A<B ko child
