// A tree is a non-linear data structure, meaning that elements are not stored in a linear sequence like in an array or a linked list12. Instead, elements are organized in a hierarchical structure, with each element having a parent-child relationship with other elements12.

// Here are some real-life examples where tree data structures are used:

// Game Development: Space partitioning trees recursively divide the space into smaller cells until a specific cell size is reached. Leaf nodes correspond to regions of the virtual environment and contain the objects that are currently within it. This process massively reduces the number of calculations and allows real-time collision detection4.
// Databases: Databases internally contain access structures called indexes, that are based on a special tree structure, called B+ Trees4.
// Domain Name Server (DNS): DNS also uses tree structures for efficient lookup and retrieval56.
// Machine Learning: Decision-based algorithms in machine learning use tree algorithms for creating decision trees456.
// File Directory Management: The file system on a computer is a typical example of a tree data structure7.
// These are just a few examples. Tree data structures are widely used in many areas due to their efficiency in handling hierarchical data, searching, sorting, and more...
