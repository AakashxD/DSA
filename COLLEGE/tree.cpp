// Any Binary tree can be treverse by 4th methods. every binary or address of binary tree is started from root
// 1-> pre order traversal 
// algo 
// label back traversal
// level 2 visit every level print noted from to right 
// any tree can transverse majorily inOrder preorder postOrder and toconstruct a binary tree from any one travseral is nt posible  group a ->inorder and pre order b->  inorder and post order we cant construct a tree with a help of preorder a post 
// Take the everyNode from pre Order traversal and select thatnode in order than keep 
// This.
