// lamda=no.of items in hashtable/size of hashtable.
// In all this for function the collision is common but we try to handle the collision with two method 
/*
when any collision occurs then key will be inserted in seperate block and the address of that block will be linked to the perivous same location block.
// insert the below keys in hashtable of size 10 by division method hk=2k+3 the collision should be handled by open hashing 3,2,9,6,11,13,7,and 12. And also find the laod factor.
// in chaning method as the no. is key is increase time to search the key is also  increase
linear 
// when collision occur then we will search next free slot then`knight`
