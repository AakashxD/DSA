// hashing is the fastest techinques
// type of hashing function
// when two diff key pointing in same location by any hash function then collision occurs
// in divison method we generally take as a prime no.
// folding method  in this method the key will be divide some part where each part has same no of digits expect from the last part add all the indiviuals parts 
//  by ignoring the last carry.
// by this it will beeeeeeeee
// multiplication method
